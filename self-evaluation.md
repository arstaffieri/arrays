#Self Evaluation
1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
* _I think that I understand how arrays work at a basic level and what they are for. They seem to be the same thing that a matrix is in math._
2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
* _I think I'm ready to move on to the next lesson. If there is something I feel I am missing, I will go back to this one._
3. What questions do you have about Arrays?
* _How do I call the last number in an array if I don't know how big the array is? Will I always know how big it is? Do I have to ask the computer to count the number of objects in an array? Wouldn't that take a rather long time if it's a huge array? Are there size limits for arrays just as a best practice?_
